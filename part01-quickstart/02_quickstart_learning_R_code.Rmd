# Quickstart guide to learning R coding {#quickstartcode}

Hereâ€™s an outline of key steps to get started learning to run commands and write code using freely available, interactutorials.
 
1. Check out the RStudio Cloud Primers
	+ The basics
	+ Working with data
1. Install the `swirl` package

To install swirl, In the `R` console run these commands:
```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("swirl")
library("swirl")
```

Then download these two tutorials
```{r, eval = F}
swirl::install_course("R Programming")
swirl::install_course("The R Programming Environment")
```

To get started with `swirl` type:
```{r, eval = F}
swirl()
```


`swirl` will guide you through the rest.  Choose one of the R Programming tutorials. If you are asked for your Coursera information just skip this using the `skip()` command.
