Important note 2: People don’t actually use the base R program! 

After you install R, icons for it will show up on your computer in the usual places.  There’s actually rarely any reason to click on these - instead, you’ll use another program called RStudio, which you'll download in the next step. 

But first, read this RStudio forum post (Links to an external site.) by  @dataandme (Links to an external site.) for a quick breakdown on R versus RStudio
