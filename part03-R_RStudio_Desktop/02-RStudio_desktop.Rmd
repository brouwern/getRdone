Very few people use the R desktop program directly; rather they use an **Interactive Development Environment (IDE)** which talks to the underling R program and provides important features not in the basic R download.  

**RStudio** is probably the most popular and is available free at: https://bit.ly/RSdesktop .  There are Windows and Mac versions - make sure you get the correct one.  

If you need more help see this [video](https://vimeo.com/203516968) from RStudio: https://vimeo.com/203516968

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_url("https://vimeo.com/203516968")
```

 
Note that the R icon is a dark blue “R”.
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_url("https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg")
```


In contrast, the *RStudio* icon is a light blue circle with a white “R” .
```{r , eval = TRUE, rstudio.logo1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The RStudio logo"}
image.file <- here::here("images/RStudio_logo.PNG")
knitr::include_graphics(image.file)
```


Here's another walkthrough of the process of downloading RStudio:
