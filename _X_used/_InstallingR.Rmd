Software: Installing R desktop

R is pretty easy to download and install. 

Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ (Links to an external site.)

Mac: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ (Links to an external site.). 

 

PC Users: Make sure you download the 64 bit version.

Mac users: If you are running an older Mac OS you may have to look around to pick the appropriate version - or better yet, try to update your OS.  If you are a student you may be able to get the update for free through your school.

When you install, make sure you are not downloading to OneDrive or another network drive as discussed here.

If you need further help see one of the videos below.  The first is one I did for PC (sorry, my fan kicked on while recording so its a bit noisy).  The second is by RStudio.
