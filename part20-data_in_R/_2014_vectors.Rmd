# Build your own dataframe part I: Vectors

## Dataframes are a type of data structure

For small datasets its often useful to build your own dataframes.  Dataframes are **objects** in R; in particular they are a type of **data structure**.  "Data structure" is just a fancy way of saying "holding or organizing data."   

We'll work with the `SeaIce` data again.
```{r}
library(Stat2Data)
data("SeaIce")
```

If we're curious about what kind of data is in an object we can use the `class()` command to see how is is classified..  Generally the first thing R spits out is the most important.

```{r}
class(SeaIce)
```

We see that `SeaIce is a `data.frame`. 

A related command is `is()`
```{r}
is(SeaIce)
```

This command is more **verbose** and tells of several things, the most relevant of which is that `SeaIce` is a dataframe.


The `SeaIce` dataframe has several columns.  We can pull up their names using the `names()` command.

```{r}
names(SeaIce)
```

There are times when we may want to examine just a single column.  We can isolate a single column using a species notation which uses a dollar sign.  To get the `Extent` column we do this

<!-- Add practice problems for this -->

```{r}
SeaIce$Extent
```


## Dataframes are made from vectors

Running this we get just a stream of numbers.  In R, such a stream of numbers is called a **vector**.  Like dataframes, vectors are a type of data structure.  We can check this with `is()`

```{r}
is(SeaIce$Extent)
```

The first result is `numeric`, which indicates that there are numbers in this vector; the second result is vector.

All columns in a dataframe are are vectors:

```{r}
is(SeaIce$Year)
is(SeaIce$Area)
```

## Make your own vectors

We can make our own vectors using the `c()` command.  (`c()` does MANY things in R, so we'll see it a lot).

Here is some more recent data on the Canda Lynx from 1984 to 2002 (Poole 2003, Table 3):
```{r}
c(13445, 8625, 6853, 6953, 6574,
  8265, 9977, 7579, 11542, 7180,
  4713, 4907, 2819, 5171, 6873, 
  6148, 8573, 9361, 11226)
```

We can save this to an R object using a very species function in R called the **assigment operator**

```{r}
lynx.ca <- c(13445, 8625, 6853, 6953, 6574,
  8265, 9977, 7579, 11542, 7180,
  4713, 4907, 2819, 5171, 6873, 
  6148, 8573, 9361, 11226)
```

We've now made a brand new object in R called `lynx.ca`.  We can see what it is by just typing its name in the console...

```{r}
lynx.ca
```
 
...and confirming what it is with `is()` and `class()`

```{r}
is(lynx.ca)
class(lynx.ca)
```


The data are from 1984 to 2002.  We can make a `year` vector like this

```{r}
year <- c(1984, 1985, 1986, 1987,
          1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 
          1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997,
          1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002)
```

Its rather tedious to do that, so R has a trick.  If we want a sequence of numbers we can use the `seq()` command, which has the arguments `from =...` and `to = ...`.

```{r}
year <- seq(from = 1984, to = 2002)
```

## Checking the length of vectors

Typing in data directly into R is errorprone and whenever we do it we should check our work carefully.  A first check should be that we entered in all the numbers; we can do this by getting R to tell us the length of the vector.  Can you guess what the command is called?

```{r}
length(lynx.ca)
```

Let's check that our year vector is the same length

```{r}
length(year)
```


## Another example

Another famous example

Howlett and Majerus.  1987. The understanding of industrial melanism in the peppered moth (*Biston betularia*) .(Lepidoptera: Geometridae).  30: 31-44.

Table 2

```{r}
year.ne <- c(1954, 1961, 1970, 1975, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985)

moths.ne <- c(92.95, 94.78, 75, 64.7, 45.9, 50, 42.9, 42.1, 39.6)
```


(Raw data is slightly more complicated, but this works)


```{r}
length(year.ne)
length(moths.ne)
```


```{r}
moths <- data.frame(year = year.ne,
                    moths.N = moths.ne)
```

```{r}
plot(moths.N ~ year, data = moths)
```

Not how R doesn't need extra space for the years where there are no data



## Try it yourself

The original lynx data that comes with R spans the year 1821â€“1934.  Make a sequence of numbers called year.lynx using the `seq()` command.

```{r}
1957:1964
```


There was a hypothesis that sunspot number and/or size impact lynx populations.  R has a dataset called sunspots that runs from 1749 to 1983.  Make a vector called year year.sunspot using the `seq()` command. 

```{r}
1749:1983
```
