## A (very) short introduction to R (Claudia Brauer)

```{r, eval = F}
swirl::install_course("A_(very)_short_introduction_to_R")
```

The author notes: 
>"Thiscourse is based on a non-interactive tutorial with the same name, which can be downloaded from www.github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R. The contents are the same (with a few exceptions), so you can open the pdf version alongside to look up how to do something you learned before or browse through the references on the last two pages."

This tutorial has 3 modules.  The first is introductory.  The others get into more details tasks, such as sourceing .R file scripts.

The key vocabulary, concepts and functions  covered in this tutorial are:

* programming language
* variable
* `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^`
* sqrt()
* abs()
* assignment operator
* <-
* help files
* vector
* c() function ("concatenate", "combine")
* element wise operation ("element-by-element")
* recycling
* vectorized operations (not discussed in those terms)
* up arrow to view command history
* tab completion ("auto-completion")

```{r, echo = F, eval = F}
# all commands used
5 + 7
x <- 5+7
x
x-3
y <- x-3
z<-  c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
?c
z
c(z, 555,z)
z*2+100
my_sqrt <- sqrt(z-1) # results in vector
my_sqrt
my_div <- z/my_sqrt
c(1,2,3,4) + c(0,10) # vector recycling
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
z*2+1000 # via up arrow
```
