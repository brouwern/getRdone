# Note on updating R (read if you've used R before!)

Important note: R is frequently updated!

If you already have R downloaded for a previous class, you should update it by downloading and reinstalling it again.   R went through a major update this past year and you need to make sure you have the newest version.

(If you just downloaded R for a class, you're good!)
