# Troubleshooting basic problems

Forgetting the second **closing parenthesis** is a major cause of mistakes when learning R.  If something doesn't work, press the **escape key** in the upper left-hand corner of your keyboards (labeled "esc" or "ESC") a couple of times, then first check to make sure you have the sneaky second `)`.  

This is important so I'll repeat it:

## Bad arguments

None of these work


```{r, eval = F, error = F}
plot(lynx, log  = y)
plot(lynx, log  = "y)
plot(lynx, log  y)
```
<!-- ASSIGNMENT:Fix these errors -->

## Hung code

When we forget a closing parenthesis in R we get **hung code**.  We think we told R to do something, like make a plot, but nothing happens.


## Missing quotes
